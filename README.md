# 📣 Vendor Voice – India’s Street Food Feedback & Grievance Portal

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Vendor Voice** is an inclusive digital platform that brings together **street food consumers**, **vendors**, and **local authorities** to foster transparency, quality, and accountability in India’s vibrant street food culture.

Drawing inspiration from civic dashboards like *Rythu Bharosa* and *SLN Dashboard* used in Andhra Pradesh, this portal operates **area-wise**, allowing users to:
- Report complaints related to **food hygiene**, **ingredient pricing**, or **vendor behavior**
- Rate vendors based on cleanliness, taste, pricing, and service
- Empower vendors with constructive feedback to improve
- Enhance trust and transparency between vendors and consumers

Whether you're a hungry foodie in a busy city lane or a vendor striving to offer safer, fairer service — **Vendor Voice** is where your voice matters.
